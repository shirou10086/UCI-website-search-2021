Hi there!
If you are the first time loading the searchengine you will need to uncomment the first two lines after //if "name" is "main"// for Milestone3.py
So that the search engine will be able to get the urldata base address and thus compute a json file for inverted index.
After the invertedindex json file been generated and urldict json file been generated I would suggest you to delete the first two lines after //if "name" is "main"// for Milestone3.py.
Then you can simply run the Milestone3.py file and input qureies what you wanted to search on the console and it will return 5 best matched urls with responce time.
You can input"Quit" to quit the program
